This section offers an overview of previous works addressing the Art Gallery Problem \cite{o1987art}. 
Working with the visibility region is a basic tool in computational geometry, specifically in the context of the Art Gallery Problem \cite{o1987art}, which is an $\exists \mathbb R$-complete problem \cite{abrahamsen2021art}. The problem class $\exists \mathbb R$ consists of instances that can be reduced in polynomial time to a decision problem of whether a system of polynomial equations with integer coefficients and any number of real variables has a solution. Since NP $\subseteq \exists \mathbb R$, the $\exists \mathbb R$ class is an even harder to solve complexity class, since $\exists \mathbb R$-complete problems are not know to have solutions of polynomial space. 
% For this reason, it is crucial that the computation time of the visibility region is efficiently implemented. 

Building on the aforementioned concepts, this section will further inspect how visibility in polygons can be efficiently computed \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/BungiuHHHK14}, how it is not always possible to place guards at rational coordinates \cite{abrahamsen2021art}, in addition to two improved polygon guarding algorithms \cite{maleki2022implementation}, \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2007-06920}.
% Some general notions that will appear in the papers are introduced below.

% Visibility in simple planar polygons can be defined as: given a polygon $\mathcal P \subset \mathbb R^2$, a point (guard) $p \in \mathcal P$ \textit{sees} a point $q \in \mathcal P$ if the line segment $\overline{pq} \subseteq \mathcal P$. Thus, the points that are visible from $p$ form the visibility polygon (region) $Vis(p)$.

% A guard set $S$ is defined as a set of points in a given polygon $\mathcal P$ such that every point in $\mathcal P$ is seen by some point in $S$. $\forall x, y \in \mathcal P$, $x$ sees $y$ if the line segment $\overline{xy} \in \mathcal P$.

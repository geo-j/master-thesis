% TODO: add general explanation for the Art Gallery Problem
This section offers an overview of previous works addressing the Art Gallery Problem \cite{o1987art}. The Art Gallery Problem \cite{o1987art} can be introduced as follows: given a simple polygon $\mathcal P$ with $n$ vertices, we are interested in finding the minimum number of guards (points) that are able to see the whole polygon. A simple polygon is a polygon that does not intersect itself when drawn in plane. Thus, we can define visibility in the polygon $\mathcal P \subset \mathbb R^2$ as a point (guard) $p \in \mathcal P$ being able to see another point $q \in \mathcal P$ if the line segment $\overline{pq} \subseteq \mathcal P$. The points that are visible from $p$ form the visibility polygon (region) $Vis(p)$. In the Art Gallery Problem, we are looking for a minimum size guard set $S$ that can see the whole polygon $\mathcal P$.

Figure \ref{fig:art} displays an example of The Art Gallery Problem \cite{o1987art} with polygon $\mathcal P$ guarded by 4 points ($|S| = 4$). The visibility region $\mathcal V$ of each guard is marked with a different colour. For point $p \in S$, its visibility region $Vis(p)$ is emphasised with the pink contour. In this case, the vertex $r$ blocks part of the view of $p$ and is called ``reflex'', because the angle it forms on the inside of the polygon is larger than $180^\circ$. Because reflex vertices are only found in concave polygons, convex polygons can then be guarded by only one guard.

Working with the visibility region is a basic tool in computational geometry, specifically in the context of the Art Gallery Problem \cite{o1987art}, which is an $\exists \mathbb R$-complete problem \cite{abrahamsen2021art}. The problem class $\exists \mathbb R$ consists of instances that can be reduced in polynomial time to a decision problem of whether a system of polynomial equations with integer coefficients and any number of real variables has a solution. Since NP $\subseteq \exists \mathbb R$, the $\exists \mathbb R$ class is an even harder to solve complexity class, since $\exists \mathbb R$-complete problems are not know to have solutions of polynomial space. 
% For this reason, it is crucial that the computation time of the visibility region is efficiently implemented. 

Building on the aforementioned concepts, this section will further inspect how visibility in polygons can be efficiently computed \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/BungiuHHHK14}, how it is not always possible to place guards at rational coordinates \cite{abrahamsen2021art}, in addition to two improved polygon guarding algorithms \cite{maleki2022implementation}, \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2007-06920}.
% Some general notions that will appear in the papers are introduced below.

% Visibility in simple planar polygons can be defined as: given a polygon $\mathcal P \subset \mathbb R^2$, a point (guard) $p \in \mathcal P$ \textit{sees} a point $q \in \mathcal P$ if the line segment $\overline{pq} \subseteq \mathcal P$. Thus, the points that are visible from $p$ form the visibility polygon (region) $Vis(p)$.

% A guard set $S$ is defined as a set of points in a given polygon $\mathcal P$ such that every point in $\mathcal P$ is seen by some point in $S$. $\forall x, y \in \mathcal P$, $x$ sees $y$ if the line segment $\overline{xy} \in \mathcal P$.

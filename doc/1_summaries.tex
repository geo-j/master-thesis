% TODO: add general explanation for the art gallery problem
This section offers an overview of previous works addressing the Art Gallery Problem \cite{o1987art}. The Art Gallery Problem \cite{o1987art} can be introduced as: given a polygon $\mathcal P$, we are interested in finding the minimum number of guards (points) that are able to see the whole polygon. Thus, we can define visibility in a simple planar polygon $\mathcal P \subset \mathbb R^2$ as a point (guard) $p \in \mathcal P$ being able to see another point $q \in \mathcal P$ if the line segment $\overline{pq} \subseteq \mathcal P$. The points that are visible from $p$ form the visibility polygon (region) $\mathcal V(p)$. The guards that see the whole polygon $\mathcal P$ form the resulting guard set $S$.

Figure \ref{fig:art} displays an example of The Art Gallery Problem \cite{o1987art} with polygon $\mathcal P$ guarded by 4 points forming the guard set $S$. The visibility region $\mathcal V$ of each guard is marked with a different colour. For point $p \in S$, its visibility region $\mathcal V(p)$ is emphasised with the pink contour. In this case, the vertex $r$ blocks part of the view of $p$ and is called ``reflex'', because the angle it forms on the inside of the polygon is larger than $180^\circ$. Because reflex vertices are only found in concave polygons, convex polygons can then be guarded by only one guard.

Building on the aforementioned concepts, the papers summarised will inspect how visibility in polygons can be efficiently computed \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/BungiuHHHK14}, how it is not always possible to place guards at rational coordinates \cite{abrahamsen2021art}, in addition to two improved polygon guarding algorithms \cite{maleki2022implementation}, \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2007-06920}.
% Some general notions that will appear in the papers are introduced below.

% Visibility in simple planar polygons can be defined as: given a polygon $\mathcal P \subset \mathbb R^2$, a point (guard) $p \in \mathcal P$ \textit{sees} a point $q \in \mathcal P$ if the line segment $\overline{pq} \subseteq \mathcal P$. Thus, the points that are visible from $p$ form the visibility polygon (region) $\mathcal V(p)$.

% A guard set $S$ is defined as a set of points in a given polygon $\mathcal P$ such that every point in $\mathcal P$ is seen by some point in $S$. $\forall x, y \in \mathcal P$, $x$ sees $y$ if the line segment $\overline{xy} \in \mathcal P$.

\subsection{Implementation of Polygon Guarding Algorithms for Art Gallery Problems \cite{maleki2022implementation}}
Maleki and Mohades \cite{maleki2022implementation} introduce their implementations and experimental evaluations for two existing approximation algorithms (\cite{GHOSH2010718}, \cite{bhattacharya2016approximability}) and a newly developed one for computing visibility in simple polygons in the context of the Art Gallery Problem \cite{o1987art}.

We distinguish between vertex guards (guards that can be placed on the vertices of $\mathcal P$) and point guards (guards that can be placed without restriction inside $\mathcal P$). If $\forall q \in \mathcal P$ is visible from some point of an edge, then $\mathcal P$ is a weak visibility polygon.

Given that computing a minimum number of guards for guarding a polygon is NP-hard \cite{1057165}, Maleki and Mohades will inspect how the Art Gallery Problem \cite{o1987art} can be tackled using three approximation algorithms.

\subsubsection{Algorithm of Ghosh \cite{GHOSH2010718}}
The algorithm of Ghosh \cite{GHOSH2010718} runs in $O(n^4)$ time and yields a $O(\log n)$-approximation for computing the minimum vertex guard for simple polygons. It begins by  computing the set of all the convex components $C$ of the polygon $\mathcal P$. Let then $F_j$ be the set of all convex components from $C$ that are visible from a vertex $j \in \mathcal P$. The redundant sets $F_j, \forall j$ are afterwards eliminated as follows: for all fixed $j$, the algorithm searches for a vertex $i \neq j, i \in \mathcal P$ such that $F_i$ is also visible from $j$ ($|F_i| \leq |F_j|$); $F_i$ is eliminated, $j$ is added to $S$ and the process continues until $C$ is empty. At the end, $S$ contains the approximated guard set for $\mathcal P$.

An example run of the algorithm is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:ghosh}. Let $\mathcal P$ be the polygon in question, and its boundary vertices $\mathcal V = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$. $\mathcal P$ is divided into two convex components $C_1$ and $C_2$, such that $C = \{C_1, C_2\}$. The sets $F_j, \forall j \in \mathcal P$ are also displayed. Since $F_1 \subseteq F_2 \subseteq F_3 \subseteq F_4 \subseteq F_6$ and $F_5 \subseteq F_3 \subseteq F_4 \subseteq F_6$, $F_1, F_2, F_3, F_4$, and $F_5$ are removed. The remaining set $F_6$ yields the final guard set $S = \{6\}$, which can see both convex regions of $\mathcal P$, and hence the whole polygon.

\subsubsection{Algorithm of Bhattacharya \cite{bhattacharya2016approximability}}
The algorithm of Bhattacharya \cite{bhattacharya2016approximability} runs in $O(n^2)$ time and yields a 6-approximation for computing the minimum vertex guard for weak visibility polygons without holes. It begins by choosing two neighbours $u, v$ as parents for every vertex in $\mathcal P$. It then computes the Shortest Path Tree from each pair of parents $u, v$ to every other vertex in $\mathcal P$. All vertices on the Shortest Path Tree are initialised as unmarked. In clockwise order from $\overline{uv}$, every vertex $z \in \mathcal P$ is checked for visibility from $u, \text{ and } v$. If all vertices $z$ are visible, then $u, \text{ and }v$ are added to $S$. Otherwise, $z$ is added to $S$ and the procedure continues with $z$ as the starting node. All vertices that become seen from $S$ are marked. At the end, the algorithm checks whether the vertices in $S$ have overlapping visibility regions, and duplicates are removed.

An example run of the algorithm is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:bhaca}. Let $\mathcal P$ be the polygon in question, and its boundary vertices $\mathcal V = \{a, b, c, d, e, f\}$. The algorithm starts with vertices $a$ and $c$ as parents of $b$. Clockwise, vertex $d$ is visible from $\overline{ac}$, but $e$ is not. For this reason, $e$ is added to the guard set $S$, and vertices $d$ and $f$ are chosen as the new parents. Clockwise, all vertices $a, b, c, e$ are visible from $\overline{ef}$, so $d$ and $f$ are added to $S$. Since the visibility regions of $d$ and $f$ coincide ($\mathcal V(d) = \mathcal V(f)$), and the visibility region of $e$ is included in that of $d$ and $f$ ($\mathcal V(e) \subseteq \mathcal V(d) \subseteq \mathcal V(f)$), $e$ and $d$ can be removed from $S$. As such, the final guard set becomes $S = \{f\}$.

\subsubsection{New Algorithm}
The algorithm introduced by Maleki and Mohades is focussed on polygons with large number of vertices $n$ and different amounts of reflex vertices $r$. If the number of reflex vertices is significantly lower than the total number of vertices ($r \leq \log \log n$), guards are placed at all reflex vertices. Otherwise, they are placed according to the algorithm of Ghosh \cite{GHOSH2010718}.

\subsubsection{Experiments}
Algorithms of Ghosh \cite{GHOSH2010718} and Bhattacharya \cite{bhattacharya2016approximability} are tested on weak visibility polygons, and the newly introduced algorithm is tested on simple polygons. 

Firstly, a procedure for generating arbitrary weak visibility polygons is devised in Figure \ref{fig:weak}: given two points $p = (k, 0), q = (-k, 0)$,  $n$ random points $\{x_1, ..., x_n\}$ sorted on the distance from $p$ on $\overline{pq}$, $n$ sorted random angles $\{\alpha_1, ..., \alpha_n\} \in  (0, \pi)$, and $n$ vertices $\{y_1, ..., y_n\}$ are created by shooting $n$ rays at the corresponding angle $\alpha_i, \forall x_i$. Then, $n$ reflex vertices $\{z_1, ..., z_n\}$ are added in the quadrilateral formed by vertices $x_iy_iy_{i + 1}x_{i + 1}$. The figure is accredited to \cite{maleki2022implementation}.

    \caption{Generated Weak Visibility Polygon for $n = 3$ \cite{maleki2022implementation}.}
    \label{fig:weak}
\end{figure}

The algorithms of Ghosh \cite{GHOSH2010718} and Bhattacharya \cite{bhattacharya2016approximability} were tested using arbitrarily generated polygons with $n = \overline{10, 15}$ vertices and $r \in \{2, 3\}$ reflex vertices. The results suggest that for low values of $n$ and $r$, the algorithm of Ghosh \cite{GHOSH2010718} performs better when using the number of guards as evaluation criteria. 
% Its constant time approximation in the small case contrasts with the constant approximation of the algorithm of Bhattacharya \cite{bhattacharya2016approximability}.
Similarly, the algorithm of Ghosh \cite{GHOSH2010718} performed better both when tested on a weak visibility polygon with low $n = \overline{10, 15}$ and $\frac n 2 \leq r$, and when tested with large $n \in \{100, 400\}$.

Secondly, a procedure for generating arbitrary simple polygons with custom number of reflex vertices $r$ is devised in Figure \ref{fig:arbitrary}. The figure was taken from \cite{maleki2022implementation} and annotated to suit the explanations in these summaries. Starting from a simple convex polygon $\mathcal P$ with $n$ vertices ($u, v, x1, x2, ..., x7$), $\mathcal P$ is triangulated such that every triangle has a joint edge with its boundaries; $r$ reflex vertices ($r1, r2, r3$) are randomly added inside $\mathcal P$, and the boundaries outside of the reflex vertices are moved such that all $r$ points are now forming boundaries.

    \label{fig:arbitrary}
\end{figure}

The new algorithm is tested on simple polygons constructed as mentioned by starting from low $r$ and gradually increasing it. The results are reported positively in the sense that the $|S|$ always remains close to the optimal, as a 2-approximation solution.

Therefore, through the newly implemented algorithm, Maleki and Mohades \cite{maleki2022implementation} testify that the algorithm of Ghosh \cite{GHOSH2010718} performs like a constant approximation in practice, and often better than its theoretical bound when tested on complex simple polygons.

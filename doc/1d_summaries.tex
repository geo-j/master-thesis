\subsection{A Practical Algorithm with Performance Guarantees for the Art Gallery Problem \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2007-06920}}
This paper \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2007-06920} introduces the idea of vision-stability, and describes an iterative algorithm that guarantees to find the optimal guard set for every vision-stable polygon in order to address the Art Gallery Problem \cite{o1987art}. Additionally, it proves that the set of vision-stable polygons admits an FPT algorithm when parametrised by the number of vertices visible from a chord of the polygon, and gives a one-shot algorithm for that matter.

The paper \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2007-06920} starts by introducing the notion of vision-stability in Figure \ref{fig:vis}. The figure was taken from \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2007-06920} and annotated to facilitate the understanding of this summary. The paper defines guards as ``enhanced'' if they can ``see around the corner'' by an angle of $\delta$ ($vis_\delta(p)$), or ``diminished'' if their vision is ``blocked'' by reflex vertices by an angle of $\delta$ ($vis_{-\delta}(p)$). As such, the size of the minimum $\delta$-guarding set is defined as $opt(P, \delta)$. A polygon $\mathcal P$ has vision-stability $\delta$ if the optimal number of enhanced guards is the same as the optimal number of diminished guards for that matter ($opt(P, -\delta) = opt(P, \delta)$).

\end{figure}

Then, it continues by defining the candidate guard set $C$ and the witness guard set $W$ that will be later used in the algorithm. Firstly, rays are shot from every reflex vertex such that the angle between any two rays is at most $\delta$, as observed in Figure \ref{fig:rays}. The figure was taken from \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2007-06920}. All the intersection points of the rays within $\mathcal P$ define the candidate guard set $C$, together with the faces they are part of. A witness guard set $W$ is then defined by picking an arbitrary interior point of every face of $\mathcal P$, together with all faces of $\mathcal P$. In this way, the problem can be discretised in a way in which the solution to the discretised problem are also solutions to the continuous problem.

\end{figure}


\subsubsection{One-Shot Vision-Stable Algorithm}
At first, an Integer Program (IP) is built and named the One-Shot Vision-Stable algorithm. It finds the minimum number of point guards in polynomial time in a vision-stable polygon $\mathcal P$ with  vision-stability $\delta$ and $r$ reflex vertices. The guards are encoded by binary integers, and linear equations and inequalities are used to encode visibility. Assuming that $\delta$ is part of the input, the algorithm returns the optimal solution only if the vision-stability of $\mathcal P$ is larger or equal to $\delta$. The one-shot vision-stable algorithm is reliable, as it also verifies that its result is an optimal solution. It is also FPT with respect to $r$. As such, the optimisation function $f_1$ of the IP is $$f_1 = (\sum_{c \in vertex(C)} c) + ((1 + \epsilon)\sum_{c \in face(C)} c) + (\epsilon \sum_{w \in face(W)} w), \frac 1 \epsilon = |C| + |W| + 1.$$ For every witness $w$, its visible set of candidates are denoted as $vis(w)$, where $face$ and $vertex$ refer to whether the candidate is a face or a vertex, respectively.

Additionally, a constraint for each vertex and face witness $w$ to be respectively seen by all candidates from $vis(w)$ is added:
% \begin{equation}
	\begin{align*}
		\sum_{c \in vis(w)} c &\geq 1, \forall w \in vertex(W) \\
		w + \sum_{c \in vis(w)} c &\geq 1, \forall w \in face(W).
	\end{align*}
% \end{equation}

Nonetheless, the one-shot vision-stable algorithm proves to be too slow for practical reasons. The bottleneck is however not solving the IP in itself, but computing visibilities. Hence, an iterative vision-stable algorithm is devised, that is faster and retains similar performance guarantees. 

\subsubsection{Iterative Vision-Stable Algorithm}
Starting with the same sets of candidates $C$ and witnesses $W$, another IP is deployed in order to find a minimum guard set $S \subseteq C$ that sees all vertex-witnesses. This algorithm is then called the Iterative Vision Stable Algorithm, as it makes use of both the One-Shot IP and the new one. 

At first, the new IP builds on the One-Shot IP by forming $W^* \subseteq W$ as a critical witnesses set with only 10\% randomly selected vertices from $W$. $W^*$ is expanded throughout the iterations with the witnesses that are not seen by the optimal solution at that moment. The new IP is referred to as the Big IP.
Then, the Big IP receives a secondary objective function $f_2$ (Equation \ref{eq:f2}). $f_2$ minimises the number of face-guards used in $S$ and the number of unseen face-witnesses. If $S$ contains only point guards and sees all face-witnesses, the algorithm reports the optimal solution by using the One-Shot IP. Otherwise, the faces of $\mathcal P$ are split (discretised) and the algorithm continues to the next iteration. The One-Shot IP is then used as soon as all faces are deemed unsplittable (they have reached a certain granularity $\lambda$). In that case, the Big IP is run again. The Big IP consists thus of a similar objective and constraints as the One-Shot Vision-Stable IP: besides assuring that all witnesses $w$ are seen by their set of candidates $vis(w)$, it also enforces that only the number of guards $s$ resulted from the One-Shot IP is used, as follows: 
\begin{align}
	f_2 &= \sum_{x \in splittable(W \cup C)} x \label{eq:f2}\\
	\sum_{c \in C} c &= s, s \in \mathbb Z, s \text{ the number of used guards in the One-Shot IP} \\
	\sum_{c \in vis(w)} c &\geq 1 \\
	1 - (\epsilon \sum_{c \in vis(w)} c) &\geq w.
\end{align}

The Iterative Algorithm is then transformed into an FPT algorithm with the parameter of chord-visibility width. Given a chord $c$ of $\mathcal P$, we count the number $n(c)$ of vertices visible from $c$. The chord-visibility width of $\mathcal P$ ($cw(P)$)  is the maximum $n(c)$ over all possible chords $c$. By using this measure, it is possible to describe the local complexity of a polygon: many synthetic arbitrary polygons have much smaller chord-visibility width than they have reflex vertices, and polygons constructed with hardness reductions have the chord-visibility width proportional to the total number of vertices. 

\subsubsection{Experimental Results}
The previously introduced algorithms are tested experimentally in terms of their running times and solution quality with respect to the input size, chord-visibility width and vision-stability of the input polygons $\mathcal P$. The tests were run on 30 instances of arbitrary simple polygons of sizes 60, 100, 200 and 500 vertices. The algorithms have been implemented both with the theoretical performance guarantees $\mathcal T$ (if no solution is found in $\mathcal T$, abort) and with the practical optimisation of critical witnesses.

When running the Iterative Algorithm with optimisations, reasonable practical results were found: all tested instances were solved to optimality, although the overall running time was not improved when compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. The median running time was also lower than the average running time, which could be accounted for by the sensitivity of the algorithm to the vision-stability of a polygon. Thus, a few polygons that are hard to solve (have low vision-stability) outweigh the rest of the running times.

When running the iterative algorithm without optimisations and with the theoretical limit $\mathcal T$ as a safe guard, a solution was found in an efficient manner (within an hour) only for 25 out of 30 instances. For the rest of the 5 instances, the Big IP performed unnecessary splits, which negatively influenced the running times.

Additionally, the correlation between the granularity $\lambda$ of the input polygon was tested for the iterative algorithm with performance guarantees $\mathcal T$. There appeared to be a strong correlation between the running times and $\lambda$. Thus, lower granularity implied a shorter running time.

In terms of the convergence to the optimal solution, the iterative algorithm with optimisations has been used to show the fast convergence in the first few iterations. The speed of the convergence slows down as the algorithm nears its end due to the increasing number of candidates and witnesses that are added to $C$ and $W^*$, respectively, in the later iterations. Nonetheless, it appears that computing the visibility area of the polygon is still the bottleneck in the algorithm's performance.

		% - $\forall$ node of $T$ is a weak visibility polygon $W$ of some defining chord $c$ => $c$ splits $P$ into 2 polygons $Q$ and $Q'$; the weak visibility polygon $W$ is completely contained in either $Q$ or $Q'$ (consider each node of $T$) to be closed and contain its boundary

\section{Thesis Project Plan}
\label{sec:thesis}

The main goal of this thesis is to find an approximate solution to The Art Gallery Problem \cite{o1987art} using gradient descent. 

So far:
- created the algorithm for one guard
- implemented the gradient computation for one guard
- get multiple polygons as test cases
- have results for polygons that require rational coordinates

Future plans:
- algorithm for multiple guards
- implement algorithm for multiple guards
- test algorithm for multiple test cases 
- compare with other algorithms (error margin)
